# Swimming the Backstroke

Backstroke is a swimming technique that allows the swimmer to move through the water leaving their airways clear of the surface. Backstroke is a great exercise for several important muscle groups including the legs and core. It can be more easily performed by people with muscular or respiratory concerns who want more control in the water during their workout.

Swimmers should use swimwear that provides adequate coverage and can absorb water without impairing the wearer or becoming damaged. If you do not have access to a private pool you can look up the closest public pool.

## Warning

Accidents in a pool environment can be fatal even if swimming is not a hazardous activity. No one should swim unsupervised and anyone does so at their own risk.

## Steps

1. **Starting position**

   - Begin by entering the water and floating on your back with your head tilted back and your arms and legs stretched out.

2. **Kicking**

   - Start kicking your feet by rotating your hips while keeping your legs as straight as possible. 
   - This step must be continued throughout the act of swimming.

3. **Starting your stroke**

   - Reach back with your right arm until your should dips below the surface of the water.

4. **Pulling through your stroke**

   - Keeping your fingers together, push your right hand back to your side.
   - If done properly you should feel yourself gliding through the water as you finish the stroke. 

5.  **Switching arms**

   - Perform steps 3 and 4 with your left arm.
   - Bring your right hand up out of the water thumb first and reach it back over your head.

6. **Swimming a lap**

   - Continue performing steps 2 through 5 while focusing on keeping your head tilted back as far as possible and breathing as necessary.
   - This will start moving you through the water at a solid pace which will speed up as your form improves.

7. **Touching the wall**

   - If swimming in a pool with marker flags, count the number of strokes you take between the flags and the wall.
   - Turning over or holding your arm out after that number of strokes until you touch the wall will help prevent head injury from swimming into the wall.
   - If your pool doesn't have any flags try to set another reference point or simply play it safe when you get towards the end of your lap.

8. **Using backstroke beneficially**

   - Now that you have backstroke down you can add it to your list of workouts.
   - Swim backstroke laps around your pool and combine it with other strokes and aquatic exercises to improve cardiac health and muscle tone.
